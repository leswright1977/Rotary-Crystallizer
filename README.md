TODO:
0.96" OLED SSD1306
The hole spacing for the OLED needs attending to! Seemingly different manufacturers have different hole spacings, mechanical drawings are thin on the ground CHECK the measurements for your OLED and edit the PCB to suit before sending files off for Manufacture!!!
Future versions will simply omit the holes. Honestly you might be better off mouting with double sided foam pads and soldering direct to the board.
I2C breakout is planned in version 2 for TMP117 sensors and expandability.
